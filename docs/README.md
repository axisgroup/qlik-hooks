# Qlik Hooks

**Qlik Hooks** is a JavaScript library that provides custom React Hooks built to interface with the Qlik Associative Engine (QAE) for building front-end React applications. Qlik Hooks are meant to simplify the complex and asynchronous nature of the Qlik Engine API into an easy to use format with React. The Qlik Hooks reposity can be found at [https://github.com/axisgroup/qlik-hooks](https://github.com/axisgroup/qlik-hooks), and can be installed in projects via npm:

```
$ npm install qlik-hooks
```
