# Qlik Hooks

**Qlik Hooks** is a JavaScript library that provides custom React Hooks built to interface with the Qlik Associative Engine (QAE) when building front-end React applications. Qlik Hooks are meant to simplify the complex and asynchronous nature of the Qlik Engine API into a format easy to use with React. The Qlik Hooks reposity can be found at [https://github.com/axisgroup/qlik-hooks](https://github.com/axisgroup/qlik-hooks), and can be installed in projects via npm:
